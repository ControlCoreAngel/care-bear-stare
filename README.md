# CARE BEARS, STARE!

Probably won't become anything. Now partnered with seanj29 for TS, but I'm busy with other things, so this will probably just sit here as a fork with no change to code and not publicly up anywhere.

## WHAT I HOPE IT WILL BECOME

A Firefox (and Chrome?) addon that marks LGBT+phobes of all ilk, from TERFs to exclusionists to anti-intersex. Because Shinigami Eyes failed us.

Fork of Shinigami Eyes.
