# CARE BEARS, STARE!

Probably won't become anything. I don't know TS or how to make an addon for browsers or anything, so this will probably just sit here as a fork with no change to code and not publicly up anywhere.

## WHAT I HOPE IT'D BECOME

A Firefox (and Chrome?) addon that marks LGBT+phobes of all ilk, from TERFs to exclusionists to anti-intersex. Because Shinigami Eyes failed us.

Fork of Shinigami Eyes.
